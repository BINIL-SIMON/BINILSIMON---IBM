About the project : Augmented Reality for Furniture Visualisation.

This project involves developing an augmented reality mobile application that helps users visualize furniture within their physical environment. Using the device's camera, users can place 3D models of furniture in their living space, move, rotate, and resize them as needed. The app will provide a realistic view of how furniture will look and fit, assisting in making purchase decisions. Additionally, the app should integrate product details, including dimensions, colors, and price. Students will also implement a user-friendly interface and an e-commerce link to browse and buy products.
